# AI Wings

AI Wings is a complete AIoT Drone System that can command and control a group of 4G/5G AI drones.  We integrate ArduPilot with the Snapdragon mobile platform and endow DIY drones with AI computing power and 4G/5G connectiviy. An embedded software based on Android is created to enable users to convert different types of drones into AIoT drones for as little as 100 USD and additional 100 grams. A drone cloud based on node.js and vue.js has also been created. Users can install our cloud server and create their own Internet of Drones.
