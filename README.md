# AI Wings

AI Wings is a complete AIoT Drone System that can command a group of AIoT drones via the 4G/5G network. We integrate ArduPilot with mobile platform and endow DIY drones with AI computing power and 4G/5G connectiviy. AI Wings consists of Android embedded software cooperating with ArduPilot, a drone cloud server based on node.js and vue.js, and VR simulation in AirSim and Unreal. Users can install our cloud server and create their own Internet of Drones. By leveraging AI Wings, users can convert different types of drones into AIoT drones for as little as 100 USD and additional 100 grams.
